# User app assignment

## Project info

This is a mock SaaS app showing a list of users, list of applications as well as User Details with application assignements. This app is meant to be used with [Claude AI assistant](https://github.com/ishankorde/Claude-AI-Assistant/blob/main/README.md). The app has a custom MCP server with several available tools (APIs). The AI Assistant connects to the MCP server to perform CRUD operations on the SaaS app using MCP server. For the list_users API, the AI assistant can render a table instead of plain text.


## This project is built with:

- Loveable for creating the SaaS app and it's UI
- Supabase for Database of users, lists and user <> app assignment
